This repository is a collection of Beemo owned and maintained configurations and presets for common
developer tools -- primarily tools used by the Beemo project and its authors.

It aims to provide a modern, evergreen, convention over configuration approach to TypeScript (and
React) only projects!

## Packages

The following packages are not tied to [Beemo](https://beemo.dev) directly, and can be used
stand-alone within their respective tools.

- [babel-preset-beemo](./packages/babel-preset) - Babel preset that utilizes `env`, `typescript`,
  and `react` presets.
- [eslint-config-beemo](./packages/eslint-config) - ESLint config that extends `airbnb`, `unicorn`,
  `react`, and a handful of other plugins.
- [jest-preset-beemo](./packages/jest-preset) - Jest preset that utilizes the circus runner, and
  provides code coverage.
- [prettier-config-beemo](./packages/prettier-config) - Prettier config that aligns with community
  standards.
- [tsconfig-beemo](./packages/tsconfig) - TypeScript configs for normal, react, and workspace based
  projects.

The following packages are configurations meant for
[Beemo drivers](https://beemo.dev/docs/provider), and are based on the packages above.

- [@beemo/config-babel](./packages/config-babel) - Config for the Babel driver.
- [@beemo/config-eslint](./packages/config-eslint) - Config for the ESLint driver.
- [@beemo/config-jest](./packages/config-jest) - Config for the Jest driver.
- [@beemo/config-prettier](./packages/config-prettier) - Config for the Prettier driver.
- [@beemo/config-typescript](./packages/config-typescript) - Config for the TypeScript driver.

And last but not least, the `dev` package that pieces everything together to provide an official
Beemo [configuration module](https://beemo.dev/docs/provider).

- [@beemo/dev](./packages/dev) - Pre-packaged configuration module for general use (if you don't
  want to manage your own).

## Contributing

So... all these configs are personal preference and won't change drastically. You're welcome to use
them as-is, but changes are unlikely to land. Feel free to create an issue otherwise so that we can
discuss the intended change.
